📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and visualization of different probability distributions using Python.
The main objective is to understand how various statistical distributions behave and how they can be visualized using histograms.

The project is useful for students, beginners in data science, and statistics learners.

🎯 Objectives

To understand different types of probability distributions

To generate random data using Python

To visualize data using histograms

To compare distributions visually

📚 Distributions Covered

Normal Distribution

Uniform Distribution

Exponential Distribution

Each distribution is plotted using a histogram for easy understanding.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

NumPy – for data generation

Matplotlib – for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook

📈 Output Description

Histograms are used to show the frequency distribution of data

Subplots are used to compare multiple distributions in a single figure

Proper titles, labels, and layout are applied for clarity

🚀 How to Run the Project



Open the Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook


Run distribution.ipynb
